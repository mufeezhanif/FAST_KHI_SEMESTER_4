Shell Scripting Practice Questions
1. A library manager wants a shell script to keep track of book records. The script should allow adding new books with details like title, author, and year, searching for books by title, listing all books, and deleting a book from the records. The script should use a text file for data storage and provide appropriate messages if a book is not found or if an invalid operation is attempted. The script should be menu-driven.

2. A server administrator needs a shell script to automate disk space monitoring. The script should check the available disk space, alert if usage exceeds 80%, and log the usage details into a file. The script should run at regular intervals and send a notification to the administrator if the disk space is critically low. The script should be menu-driven.

3. A coffee shop wants a shell script to automate order processing using a menu-driven system. The script should allow customers to select a coffee type (Espresso, Cappuccino, or Latte) and choose a size (Small, Medium, or Large). The script should validate the input and display an error if an invalid choice is made. After selection, the script should calculate the total price based on coffee type and size. If a customer orders more than 3 cups, a discount should be applied. Additionally, if the customer is a loyal member, they should receive an extra discount. The script should run in a loop until the user chooses to exit, ensuring smooth order processing with multiple if-else conditions for input validation, discount application, and pricing.
